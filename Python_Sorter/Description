Project created for Programming Language Research Project. 

Program takes a .txt file with a list of things and sorts them using different methods (Bubble, Merge, Quick), counting the number of iterations as it does so.
Also has the option of adding items to different data structures (Tree, Stack, Linked List), sorting them afterwards.

** Program is not finished. **
